# fractals

I was watching a video, and in it they were talking about fractals.  
One of the points they made was: If you had the 3 corners of a trangle, and then put a dot somewhere inside that triangle, you could then randomly choose one of the corners of the trangle and make a new dot halfway between it and the starting dot.  
This could then be repeated over and over, putting a dot halfway between the last dot drawn and a randomly chosen corner of the triangle.  

Eventually with enough iterations you would end up with a fractal called the [Sierpiński triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle)

So I wrote this to program to quickly try it out, and that method does produce a Sierpiński triangle:

I thought that was pretty cool :)
